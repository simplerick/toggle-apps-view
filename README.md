# Toggle Apps View

A GNOME Shell extension that makes leaving the applications view or overview faster:

- Use the **`Show all apps`** shortcut as a real toggle: pressing it again immediately closes the apps grid.
- Press **`Esc`** once to close the overview (if search is active, Esc clears it first).

To restore default behavior you need to disable extension and reload session.

## Acknowledgements
The extension is based on ["escape-overview"](https://github.com/raelgc/escape-overview) extension by "raelgc".
